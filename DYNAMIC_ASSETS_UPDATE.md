## How to Add More Products

1. Visit [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)
2. Search for fashion items (e.g., "summer dress", "leather jacket")
3. Click on an image you like
4. Copy the photo ID from the URL
5. Add to `products.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: "product-21",
  name: "Your Product Name",
  description: "Product description",
  image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-{PHOTO_ID}?w=600&h=800&fit=crop",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied:

- ✅ Consistent image dimensions (600x800px)
- ✅ Quality parameter set to 80 (good balance)
- ✅ `fit=crop` ensures proper aspect ratio
- ✅ Unsplash CDN provides fast delivery
- ✅ Next.js Image component can optimize further

### Recommendations:

- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for automatic optimization
- Implement lazy loading (Next.js does this by default)
- Consider adding blur placeholders
- Cache images in production

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check these pages:**

   - Home page: Should show diverse product images
   - Products page: All 20 products with unique images
   - Track Order page: Different order items and collections

3. **Verify images load:**
   - All images should load from Unsplash
   - No broken image links
   - Consistent sizing and quality

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Dynamic Image Generation**: Use the `imageUtils.ts` functions to generate random images
2. **Image Caching**: Implement service worker for offline support
3. **Multiple Images**: Add image galleries for each product
4. **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image optimization API
5. **Fallback System**: Automatic fallback to alternative sources if Unsplash is down

### Example: Random Image Generation

```typescript
import { getRandomFashionImage } from "@/data/fashion1/imageUtils";

const product = {
  // ...
  image: getRandomFashionImage("dresses"),
};
```
